</p>
<p>
We start out with a ticket being created. It was created by a salesman named Ken and he says that the file server is down and he can not access imporant documents that he needs to close a sale. Becasue of how time sensitive this ticket is, Jane from the help desk assigns it an Ser-A SLA. Ser-A tickets are required to be completed in an hour. Jane will assign the ticket to John the sysadmin.

</p>
<p>
John will receive the ticket and see it when he opens his Agent Panel on osTciket. He will gather as much information on the problem before he works on the ticket. He may contact Ken for more information.

John will get the file server back up and close the ticket.
